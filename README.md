# David Salomón's dotfiles

## The Repository

This repository is were I store the dotfiles that I use on my GNU/Linux system. What are dotfiles? you may ask, these are the files that start with a period (a dot). The GNU/Linux filesystem treats them as hidden files and/or folders. Most of the time this hidden files correspond to configurations of certain programs installed on you computer, that's the main reason many people store their dotfiles, because it serves as a backup to a configuration that you have set in a program. The content of this repository is freely available for everyone to view, download and modify.

Most of my dotfiles correspond to configuration files for various window managers. For the past months I have been using [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) as my daily window manager, and thus, it's the [most complete and documented configuration](https://github.com/david35mm/.files/tree/main/.config/qtile) that I have posted on this repository. Nevertheless, I have tried [spectrwm](https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm#readme) and [herbstluftwm](https://herbstluftwm.org/index.html), and both of my configs to those window managers are posted here.

## Who is David Salomón?

I am an Electronic Engineering student, passionate about computers and everything related to it. I was born in Bogotá, the capital city of the South American country Colombia. My nickname in almost all of the social media I am registered on is david.35mm. Why? In the last few years, one of my main hobbies has been photography, I even started a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8MDD0AHj0-ZUPolunq6MQ). There I shared some tips and explain some concepts about photography, you are free to check out my videos but... as a native Spanish speaker all of my videos are going to be in that language. The 35mm on my nickname is because of the measurement of the photographic film used in the past. As a photography enthusiast I also have my own [portfolio](https://spark.adobe.com/page/yADDtrHvBow4p/), as you can see I love portraits and thus I base almost all of my work on this type of art.
