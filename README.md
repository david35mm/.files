# David Salomón's dotfiles

## The Repository

This repository is where I store the dotfiles that I use on my GNU/Linux system. What are dotfiles? you may ask, these are files that start with a period (a dot). Most of the time this hidden files correspond to configurations of certain programs installed on you computer, that's the main reason many people store their dotfiles.

## The Dotfiles Stored in Here

Most of my dotfiles correspond to configuration files for various window managers. For the past months I have been using Awesome as my daily window manager, along with Qtile they are the most complete and documented configurations that I have posted on this repository. Nevertheless, I have tried other window managers such as spectrwm, herbstluftwm, wingo, among others. All of my configs to those window managers are posted here along with the ones of some other utilities.

## Who is David Salomón?

I was an Electronic Engineering student, now seeking to study Computer Science, passionate about computers and everything related to it. I was born in [Bogotá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), the capital city of the South American country [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia).

In the last few years, one of my main hobbies has been photography, I even started a [small YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8MDD0AHj0-ZUPolunq6MQ). I shared some tips and explain some concepts about photography, you are free to check out my videos but... as a native Spanish speaker all of my videos are going to be in that language.

The 35mm on my nickname is because of the measurement of the photographic film used in the past. As a photography enthusiast I also have [my own portfolio](https://spark.adobe.com/page/yADDtrHvBow4p/), as you can see I love portraits and thus I base almost all of my work on this type of art.

If you are wondering what GNU/Linux distribution I use, it has been Artix for the last year. I'm thinking on going back to Fedora and try the rawhide edition. Want to talk with me (or even practise your Spanish)? DM me over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/david35mm.co).
