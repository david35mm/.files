## The Repository

This repository is where I store the dotfiles that I use on my GNU/Linux
system. What are dotfiles? you may ask, these are files that start with a
period (a dot). Most of the time this hidden files correspond to
configurations of certain programs installed on you computer, that's the main
reason many people store their dotfiles. The contents of this repository are

## The Dotfiles Stored in Here

Most of my dotfiles correspond to configuration files for various window
managers. For the past months I have been using Awesome as my daily window
manager, along with Qtile they are the most complete and documented
configurations that I have posted on this repository. Nevertheless, I have
tried other window managers such as spectrwm, herbstluftwm, wingo, among
others. All of my configs to those window managers are posted here along with
the ones of some other utilities.

## Who is David Salomón?

I was an Electronic Engineering student, now seeking to study Computer
Science, passionate about computers and everything related to it. I was born
in [Bogotá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1), the capital city of
the South American country [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia).

In the last few years, one of my main hobbies has been photography, I even
started a [small YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8MDD0AHj0-ZUPolunq6MQ).
I shared some tips and explain some concepts about photography, you are free
to check out my videos but... as a native Spanish speaker all of my videos
are going to be in that language.

The 35mm on my nickname is because of the measurement of the photographic
film used in the past. As a photography enthusiast I also have
[my own portfolio](https://spark.adobe.com/page/yADDtrHvBow4p/), as you can
see I love portraits and thus I base almost all of my work on this type of art.

If you are wondering what GNU/Linux distribution I use, I decided to come back
to Fedora on the stable branch even though I would really like to try the
rawhide edition. For almost all 2021 I used Artix Linux (with s6 init), If you
are wondering why I decided to go back with Fedora, I would just say "El buen
hijo vuelve a casa". Want to talk with me (or even practise your Spanish)? DM
me over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/david35mm.co).
