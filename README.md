# David Salomón's dotfiles

## The Repository

This repository is where I store the dotfiles that I use on my GNU/Linux system. What are dotfiles? you may ask, these are the files that start with a period (a dot). The GNU/Linux file system treats them as hidden files and/or folders. Most of the time this hidden files correspond to configurations of certain programs installed on you computer, that's the main reason many people store their dotfiles, because it serves as a backup to a configuration that you have already made on a program. The content of this repository is freely available for everyone to view, download and modify.

## The Dotfiles Stored in Here

Most of my dotfiles correspond to configuration files for various window managers. For the past months I have been using Qtile as my daily window manager, and thus, it's the most complete and documented configuration that I have posted on this repository, also is the one that I am currently adding and modifying stuff. Nevertheless, I have tried other window managers such as spectrwm, herbstluftwm, wingo, among others. All of my configs to those window managers are posted here along with the ones of some other utilities.

## How to Install This Repository?

I have an automated script that clones this repo and applies some other changes to the system. Unfortunately most of it only works for Fedora (just the software installation scripts, some other options are *kind of* distro agnostic), some of the changes include a better DNF config and aliases, the automatic installation of some window managers and the software selection I use... among other things. If you want to run the script in your system Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Shift+V on your terminal this command:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/david35mm/.files/main/DavidsFedoraTool.sh)
```

## Who is David Salomón?

I am an Electronic Engineering student, passionate about computers and everything related to it. I was born in Bogotá, the capital city of the South American country Colombia. My nickname in almost all of the social media I am registered on is david.35mm. Why? In the last few years, one of my main hobbies has been photography, I even started a small YouTube channel. There I shared some tips and explain some concepts about photography, you are free to check out my videos but... as a native Spanish speaker all of my videos are going to be in that language.

The 35mm on my nickname is because of the measurement of the photographic film used in the past. As a photography enthusiast I also have my own portfolio, as you can see I love portraits and thus I base almost all of my work on this type of art.
