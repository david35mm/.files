# These are some global configuration options for Wingo. It may not look like
# there's a lot here, but that's because a lot of the configuration is done
# with your key/mouse bindings, and your theme settings.

[Options]
# The list of workspaces to set upon startup. Workspaces can be added or
# removed while Wingo is running.
workspaces := web dev sys doc chat game media gfx

# The default layout that is used for all workspaces. Currently, the
# only available layouts are: Floating, Vertical or Horizontal.
# Setting this to something other than a Floating layout effectively turns
# Wingo into a tiling window manager.
default_layout := Vertical

# When enabled, windows will be focused when the mouse enters the window.
# N.B. I don't use focus follows mouse, so I'm not sure precisely how it
# should work. If I've messed up, file a bug report.
focus_follows_mouse := no

# If "focus_follows_mouse" is enabled, then this setting will focus a window
# whenever the pointer moves into the window.
focus_follows_mouse_focus := yes

# If "focus_follows_mouse" is enabled, then this setting will raise a window
# whenever the pointer moves into the window.
focus_follows_mouse_raise := no

# If "focus_follows_mouse" is enabled, then this setting will focus a new
# window when it has been created. (Otherwise, a new window will be raised
# but not focused.)
focus_follows_mouse_startup_focus := no

# If enabled, head focus will follow the mouse. That is, moving the mouse to
# another monitor will move the focus to the workspace on that monitor.
# Note that this does not require that "focus_follows_mouse" be enabled;
# however this only works when the mouse is directly over the root window.
# (So enabling this option might be weird if "focus_follows_mouse" is
# disabled.)
#
# N.B. It is possible that this could have an effect on performance, since
# most pointer motion events on the root window must be inspected.
focus_follows_mouse_head := no

# Whether error messages should be shown or not. Error messages typically
# show up when you've tried to do something illegal with one of Wingo's
# commands.
# Error messages acquire focus and do not disappear until they lose focus, or
# if the "confirm" or "cancel" keys have been pressed.
show_popup_errors := yes

# Whether FYI messages should be shown or not. These are typically used to
# indicate state changes, like when a the current workspace is changed.
# Note that FYI messages only appear for a set amount of time (see "popup_time"
# below) and then disappear. They never acquire focus.
show_popup_fyi := yes

# The time that an "FYI" message window stays visible in milliseconds.
# After time expires, the message disappears.
popup_time := 500

# The key that acts as the "confirm" key. This is mostly used in prompts. When
# the confirm key is pressed, the prompt will execute an action corresponding
# to the inputted text or the selected item.
confirm := Return

# The key that acts as the "cancel" key. This is mostly used in prompts. When
# the cancel key is pressed, the prompt disappears and no action occurs.
cancel := Escape

# The shell to be used to launch commands.
# It is used like so: `SHELL -c "{COMMAND}"`.
# If you need to pass additional arguments to the shell invocation, then
# you'll need to make a wrapper script.
# (Make sure it can handle the `-c` flag!)
shell := bash

# The program to use to play a wav file. This is only used with the "Dale"
# command, which is an easter egg.
audio_play_cmd := aplay
