# Hooks are a way to run arbitrary Wingo commands whenever a certain event
# occurs. The idea is to specify a set of match conditions and a set of
# commands that are executed for some particular event. Match conditions are
# run when the event occurs, and if the match conditions executes successfully,
# the associated commands are executed.
#
# The following hooks are allowed:
# startup, restart, managed, focused, unfocused
#
# (I'd like to add more hooks. But I'd rather add too few than add too many.)
#
# A hook is started with some label like "[MyHookName]". The label can be
# anything, and is used in the Wingo logs when you need to debug your hook.
# (This requires running wingo with `--log-level 4`, which generates a lot
# of noise in the logs. But grep'ing for your hook name should cut through
# the noise quite nicely.)
#
# Every hook also needs a "match" option set. A hook that always matches
# can be specified with "match := True". A hook that never matches can be
# specified with "match := False". The "match" option must be set to commands
# that return either a 0 or a 1. Namely, such commands can be found with the
# prefix "Match", like "MatchClientName". There are also logical commands
# "Not", "Or" and "And" to help you form more complex conditions. Finally,
# multiple match conditions can be specified by simply adding more with
# subsequent assignments to "match".
#
# All commands attached to "match" are combined conjunctively. That is, all
# match conditions must return "1" in order for the hook to fire. Alternatively,
# if the "conjunction" option is set to "no", the commands will be combined
# disjunctively. That is, at least one match condition must return "1" in
# order for the hook to fire.
#
# In order to specify the commands to run when the hook fires, you'll need to
# add them to the particular hook group listed above (i.e., "startup" or
# "focused".) This works just like "match", in that you can add commands to
# execute by adding them with successive definitions of "hook_group := ...".
#
# Finally, the special string ":client:" is replaced in every command by the
# client that executed the hook. (If it's appropriate. For instance, no
# substitution will occur on the "startup" hook.)
#
# Let's walk through an example that, in simple terms, tries to match a
# terminal window and then maximize it and removes its decorations
# when it's first managed.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# [MaximizeTerminals]
# match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "lxterminal"
# match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "konsole"
# match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "urxvt"
# match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "xterm"
# match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "gnome-terminal"
#
# conjunction := no
#
# managed := FrameSlim ":client:"
# managed := Maximize ":client:"
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Here we name our hook "MaximizeTerminals". (You'll see this name if there was
# problem setting up your hook.) We specify 5 different command match
# conditions, and disable conjunctive evaluation, so that only ONE of the match
# commands needs to return true in order for the managed hook to fire. If we
# didn't disable conjuctive evaluation, then no window would ever be able to
# match our conditions.
#
# Finally, we set the "managed" hook to run the commands 'FrameSlim ":client:"'
# and 'Maximize ":client:"'. The special ":client:" string will be replaced
# with the id of the client that was managed. (You can think of ":client:" as
# semantically equivalent to a preprocessor macro.)

[Autostart]
match := True

# You can add startup programs here if you like.
startup := Shell "./.config/herbstluftwm/panel.sh"
startup := Shell "dunst"
startup := Shell "lxpolkit"
startup := Shell "nitrogen --restore"
startup := Shell "picom"
startup := Shell "xfce4-power-manager"

# You can add more by just adding another definition of "startup".
#startup := Shell "gkrellm"

# Easter egg!
#startup := Dale

[ForceFloating]
# This hook matches certain windows, and forces them into the floating layout.
# You probably don't need to add windows like "gmrun" or "krunner", since
# they are automatically inferred to be floating.
match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "gimp"

# Typically match conditions are combined as a set of conjunctions. That is,
# all match conditions must be met for the hook to fire. But here, we want
# to fire the hook if *any* of the match conditions match, so we disable
# the default conjunction mode.
conjunction := no

# Just make sure it's floating.
managed := Float ":client:"

[FocusTransparency]
# If you have a compositing manager running, this will use transparency
# to indicate focus.
match := True

focused := SetOpacity ":client:" 1.0
unfocused := SetOpacity ":client:" 0.85

[StupidKDE]
# This hook is to make sure the KDE splash window isn't decorated on startup.
# Unfortunately, it appears the KDE folks don't care to let us know this fact
# in a standard way...
match := MatchClientClass ":client:" "ksplashx"

managed := FrameNada ":client:"
